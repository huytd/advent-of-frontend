title: What makes a good Vietnamese font?

In Donny Trương's Master's thesis on Vietnamese Typography, there is a chapter that discusses some of the challenges in designing fonts that support Vietnamese. But from the perspective of a "font user", reading it can help one gain many experiences in choosing a good font. 

Some points that the paper points out that we can use as criteria for evaluating the fonts include:

- The position of tone marks for different characters should be in the same direction, especially tone marks that accompany vowels like ế ể ề ứ ứ ứ ớ ớ ớ. This element is important because uniform positioning helps with a reader's flow, making it easier to read and avoiding interruptions in the eye's scanning flow. 
- In addition, tone marks must also be equal in size with the character carrying them, not falling on the character before or after it.
- Vowels with accents must have the accent mark in the same position, not slanted. For example, ư ơ Ư Ơ â ô Â Ô.
- The size of the tone marks is very important, as being too large or too small will disrupt the balance and make it difficult to read. 
- For serif fonts, the boldness/lightness of the strokes in the marks should be consistent with the character containing them. 
- When the vowel i is accompanied by a tone mark, the dot above the i does not need to appear because it is redundant.

For more information, I recommend reading entire thesis of the author Donny Trương.

**Comment from @monodyle:**

Speaking of making Vietnamese fonts, I used to know a friend who studied at a College of Fine Arts and had a thesis to create a font. When we sat down for some iced tea, my friend told me that making Vietnamese fonts compared to other fonts that use the Latin alphabet is something very...difficult. 

Here is a summary of a few points:

- Vietnamese has many pairs of letter that when placed side by side, are very difficult to read when making a typeface with a heavy weight like black or heavy. For example, the font Roboto Black has the letters Tì / Tĩ that are very difficult to see because the ~ overlaps with the T. 
- Also because of the syllables and tone marks in Vietnamese, kerning spacing for fonts is also very difficult. For example, if using IBM Plex Sans, people will see that the spacing between letters Ti or WA looks pleasing to the eye, but when applied to Vietnanese and kerned with a font like that, the letters Tĩ / Tỉ look very uncomfortable.
- For the reason above, setting the weight for the tone marks is also very hard. If it is too large, the characters will lose balance, and if it is too small, it will not harmonize with the font. 

Making Vietnamese fonts is also kind of an art. 

**Comment from @thien:**

Tã and Tễu is the unit test of font design in Vietnamese :laughing:

“Lift” -> English has same problems but the “conflicts” are often of the same shapes
e.g. the horizontal bar of f and t can be perfectly connected in the famous ligature “ft”. Meanwhile, “~” and “T” are not of the same shape, or not even aligned

Fun fact: Donny Trương là advisor của Inter on Vietnamese :adore: that’s why: https://twitter.com/_thiendo/status/1403915963326627840?s=46&t=HgJF1UeHuJod_aB7tIpYBg
